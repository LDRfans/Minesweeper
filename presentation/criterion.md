**Presentation with slides**: Due to time limitation, there will be no in-class presen- tation. Instead, each group should prepare and record an oral presentation (< **3min**, < 20MB, MP4 file format) with slides. The presentation should focus on your high- level idea, and leave any technical details to the writeup. (25 points)
